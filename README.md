### 🎯 Suggested Conferences for My Work (EEG + Medical ML + Imaging + Signal‑based)

- **MICCAI** — For medical imaging & healthcare‑oriented AI work.  
- **NeurIPS / ICML / ICLR** — For strong ML/DL methodology if I’m working on signal or image-based models (e.g. EEG classification, deep‑learning for medical images).  
- **AISTATS / UAI** — If I focus on statistical / probabilistic modeling for biomedical / EEG data.  
- **CVPR / ICCV / ECCV** — If I handle imaging / image‑analysis parts (medical imaging, segmentation).  
- **ICDAM** — If I want to focus on data mining / analytics on health data, large‑scale data processing, metadata, etc.

## ✅ Tips Before Submitting to Any Conference

- Always check the **latest official CFP / website** for exact deadlines & paper‑format guidelines.  
- For student authors: collaborating with a senior co‑author (advisor / guide) often helps.  
- Ensure your work has novelty + solid experiments (especially important for top conferences like NeurIPS, MICCAI, etc.)  
- For medical‑AI work: pay attention to **ethical considerations, dataset size, reproducibility, validation** (e.g. cross‑validation, clinical relevance).
